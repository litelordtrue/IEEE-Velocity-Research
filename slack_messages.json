        "text": "Okay so here's a \"back-of-the-napkin\" model for doing this using existing core components:\n1. `dashboard` module, defines a content entity type called `dashboard` which supports bundles, and defines a `dashboard_variant` config entity type;\n2. There is a `default` `dashboard_variant` which is used as the \"default\", but admins can add new \"personas\" or \"variants\" by adding a new bundle, `default` cannot be deleted;\n3. Each `dashboard_variant` (or \"persona\") has Layout Builder overrides enabled by default and we alter the forms to make it not possible to disable overrides, but individual personas (`dashboard_variant` config entitles) can be disabled or deleted (which would be the equivalent of turning off layout overrides for `node` or any other entity type);\n4. The Standard Profile ships several \"personas\" to match the roles (e.g. Admin, Content Editor, etc), and we have some kind of way of matching a Dashboard to one or more roles (maybe just used the conditions system that Blocks use for visibility, but with only role based conditions, none of the page stuff);\n5. Lets say the user-facing path is `/admin/dashboard` , on `/admin/dashboard` the user is presented with whatever \"persona\" is applicable to them;\n6. Optionally the user can choose to customise their view of the Dashboard, they do this by triggering something (e.g. by clicking a \"Customise\" button), the first time they do this a new `dashbaord` entity is created, attached to that user, and the Layout from the applied \"persona\" is copied to that entity behind the scenes;\n7. `/admin/dashboard` now renders that user's `dashboard` instead of the \"persona\" dashboard;\n8. The user is then able to edit their own `dashboard` using the Layout Builder UI, maybe there's some kind of curated list of available blocks, because all the normal ones probably don't make sense;\n9. The user can also \"revert\" their dashboard back to the default, doing this would behind the scenes, just delete their `dashboard` entity, meaning for them `/admin/dashboard` automatically just falls back to displaying the appropriate \"persona\" (or `dashboard_variant`).\nThere, I just designed a fully featured Dashboard system, with persona and user-level customisations using entirely existent core components. Take that D7 Dashboard!",

We ended up with a \"one size fits all\" approach with a bunch of views in that were easy to create, but not very useful day-to-day.\n\nSo if we're going to bring it back, it needs some actual design/thought behind what blocks it needs to show, and to whom, and we need some folks stepping up to make those \"inner parts\" come to reality, even if that means adding some extra features here and there (e.g. the ability to show views as charts, as an example).\n\nAnd _definitely_ agreed it's a whole other initiative and shouldn't block this one in any way. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nDefinitely worth an ideas issue though!

I can appreciate those who might be reluctant to knowingly add tech debt, but I feel adding a little bit of manageable debt to an unfinished + experimental theme is a fine tradeoff for maintaining momentum on a great new feature with healthy community enthusiasm behind it.",

The only outstanding one is about the lazy builders in the cache contexts.\n\nI will be off from tomorrow until next Thursday, so *it\u2019d be great if during that time you can resolve the open threads within the MR that are fully addressed*. And of course, if anybody wants to work on that lazy builder task you\u2019re more than welcome to it. Otherwise I\u2019ll pick up new feedback and existing tasks once I\u2019m back.\n\ncc <@U06NAEYSF>",
