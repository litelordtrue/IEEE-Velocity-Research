There I noticed this needs to be fixed in the info.yml:\n\n<code>description: Module for notify latest updates from drupal community</code>\n\nThat should be more like:\n\n<code>description: Notifies site users about latest updates from the Drupal community</code>\n\nThere may be more text to review, I only noticed this because I looked at how its enabled and whether it can be disabled.\n\n2. I also noticed that this feature is entirely opt-in (not added to either install profile as far as I see). Is that intentional for this step or as a final solution?\n\n3. Re \\determine if we need to start as experimentalor can skip experimental since it is not a site-feature\\\" from the issue summarythis is a site feature. Admin facing features are still site features? The question is how much would you expect the API to changeor if at all there is an API even.\"",

There is no api really at this point. It points to the Drupal.org feed, and there were notions about a '2.0' version having multiple, user configurable endpoints - but I think that's out of scope. </li>\n</ol>",

What is a dot supposed to signify? It's too vague I think.The \\\"learn more\\\" link looks like a buttonbut it behaves as a link. It would be better if it looked like a linknamely underlined text rather than a 4-sided border.The \\\"learn more\\\" link has <code>_target=\\\"blank\\\"</code> which is a massive pain-in-the-accessibleespecially since there is no warning that it will open a new window. It fails WCAG SC 3.2.5 Change On Request (level AAA). We really-really-really need to minimise the use of this attribute.  In this caselet's just remove it.I haven't done any other accessibility review yetor even used the moduleso this comment doesn't amount to sign-off.\"",

    "Comment Body": "One big concern I have here is that this would introduce a whole new pattern in the form of the dialogue/widget/whatever-you-call-it that drops down from the \\Announcements\\\" toolbar button (I'm going to just call it \\\"new component\\\" in this post for simplicity).This new component introduces a new CSS and some JavaScriptthis means additional user interface elements to maintain. Core already provides the off-canvas dialogueand I think it would be better if that were to just be used here.The off-canvas dialogue could probably also use some lovebut it does not make sense to introduce an entirely new component into Corewith its own separate CSS/JSwhen what we already have a suitable component ready to be used.The existing off-canvas dialogue has already gone through accessibility compliance and is already well integrated with Core and contrib.  The idea that we should then introduce anothervery similar componentwith its own designwhich requires its own separate long-term maintenancemakes me nervous.  We should be aiming for consistency in our Core UInot divergence.Thanks-Aaron",

    "Comment Body": "I opened an issue in the module queue, otherwise i think it'll be very hard to keep track of all the feedback [#3233439]. In short: JS needs some work, using dialogs API directly, not using jquery when it's not needed, using data attributes instead of classes.\n\nSome feedback not captured in the opened issue: \n\n<ol>\n  <li>I would expect some validation on the link to make sure it's a Drupal/DA controlled domain that it points to. To make sure that if/when the feed itself is compromised we don't send people to a malicious URL.</li>\n  <li>The experience is a bit jarring, clicking several times on the announcement link makes the bar \\flash\\\" because it's making a new request instead of updating what's in there (or not doing anything)probably needs some discussion around what we expect to happen. I would go for several clicks = toggle the sidebar (without refreshing) to keep thing in line with the other buttons of the toolbar</li><li>The icon looks fuzzy to meit's too small to have shading (or have several version based on display density). Just noticed it's a pngany reason why it's not a svg as well?</li><li>There is a cache by user but if I dismiss a featured announcement it just comes back on the next page reload. I would expect the announcement to not be shown or be shown as a non-featured item. Or maybe it's a feature that it's <em>very</em> visible all the time </li><li>The contrast ratio of the \\\"normal\\\" updates probably doesn't pass accessibility guidelines. It's hard to read for me at least</li><li>The style is not consistent between the different themeon claro and olivero there are difference in spacingalignementand even the style of the close button</li><li>For the /announcement pageit should probably be rendered in the admin theme and not the frontend theme no? The announcement toolbar button should probably also be hidden when on that page. There are style missing for the focused close button when viewed as a page</li><li>Thinking about it we should probably remove the close button altogether from the focused announcementit doesn't do anythingwhat is needed is a way to downgrade the focused announcement to a \\\"normal\\\" one after a while to avoid showing the same thing all the time if there aren't many announcements.</li><li>Focus style are missing for the \\\"Learn more\\\" buttoncan't see anything when it's keyboard focused</li></ol>The contrib module is not in sync with this merge requestI'd advise to keep the two very close as I expect there will be a good number of comments and requests for updates. That's what being done for the CKeditor5 modulesee [#3201824] and [#3231364]. The core merge request is generated by a scripti think it'd be  a good idea to follow a similar pattern here. Issues that touch on UX always tend to take a while to get in with many discussionsit's easier to manage and follow when each point has it's own issue. (Like the accessibility feedback could have it's own issue to discuss all accessibility related implications of this new UIBut so far it's exciting to see this running on a site!",

Specially if it's a forced <code>_target=\\\"blank\\\"</code> as @andrewmacpherson mentions. An option would be the <a href=\\\"https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/107823/is-there-a-common-or-typical-icon-for-an-external-link-to-a-company-web-site\\\">standard external icon</a>.On a Design perspectiveI think Design should be its own independent point in the remaining tasks list. ;)1. Firstthis doesn't follow neither the current <a href=\\\"https://www.figma.com/file/OqWgzAluHtsOd5uwm1lubFeH/Drupal-Design-system?node-id=553%3A0\\\">Design System Claro is implementing</a> nor Seven's. My guess is this implementation is based on Ana Barcelona's work a while ago and the designs have evolved since then. For examplethere aren't outlined buttons anymore (like the one on the blue region).2. Another point is that links should be blue and underlined. Other visual elements should ideally be used to show that that's been \\\"read\\\" instead of lowering the color to graylike block background coloriconsor just use a different elements instead of a basic link.<img src=\\\"/files/issues/2021-09-16/links.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />3. The bell iconcould be simplified to play better with the rest of the icons. On the leftthe current icon. On the rightan example of a simpler icon style (no the same color tough).<img src=\\\"/files/issues/2021-09-16/icon.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />On a code perspective:1. I'd say that we shouldn't be using PNG for icons: it should be SVGs so some accessibility concerns like the ones expressed by Andrew in <a href=\\\"#comment-14219226\\\">#27</a> can be addressed.2. This is also introducing a lot of opinionated CSS (thatas @AaronMcHale mentionswill need to be maintained) that is not following existing guidelines. How will this look like on a site using Seven? I think @lauriii can actually give way better feedback herebut ideally a module should just introduce the minimum styles to make it work and let each of the admin themes add its own visual styles.3. As you can see on the GIF I've uploadedthere's an overlap between the title and the close button on narrow screens.Anywaythanks for posting this here and the chance to have this feedback round with some code to test already! :)\"",

I recall the UK government dropped them in favour of visible text to say it was external.The new bell icon is excellent. I was also going to suggest using a cut-out instead of overlap. It will adapt to forced-colour modes in monochrome; the bell and circle-badge will be the same colourwith a clear separator line. That's a strong affordance that it's an additional badge applied to the bell.<hr>Do the disks on the right hand side signify anything? I was wondering if they mean new or un-visited. I think text would convey this more clearly: \\\"new\\\" is what forum module uses.ggVG\"",

    "Comment Body": "Re. #37:\n\nAt first glance this icon looked to me like an axe! I think that's a problem with 2-dimensional silhouette icons. Some of the other megaphone icons on the Noun Project page look clearer:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Some are 3-dimensional. The megaphone's cone shape is apparent.</li>\n  <li>Many have some extra lines, the common cartoon way of showing that sound is coming out of it.</li>\n  <li>Many have the central part which sticks out from the middle of the megaphone cone.</li>\n  <li>A few have a person holding the megaphone. These are verb-focused (talk) rather than noun-focused (megaphone).</li>\n</ul>\n\nI don't recall seeing a megaphone icon before. (A very similar-looking icon is a side view of a loudspeaker, which is often used for volume control.)\n\nI don't have hard numbers, but I think the bell icon is a more common icon for \\notify\\\" or \\\"message\\\"? A speech bubble is another icon which could work for announcement.\"",

    "Comment Body": "I think there are a few things that need to be improved before considering a +1. I’m concerned with Claro’s blue and other styles forced into all themes with this CSS.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I would expect from this project minimum styles, this is how it would look like reusing the off-canvas already existing styles.\n\n<img src=\\/files/issues/2021-10-25/Captura%20de%20Pantalla%202021-10-25%20a%20les%2012.25.21.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />I’ve removed locally all the opinionated CSS in <code>announcements_feed.dialog.css</code>like colorsand left only paddings/margins and hidden undesired visual elements like the default title pencil icon.Claro’s visual improvements can be added later as a follow-upor at least they shouldn't appear when Seven is enabled right now.Alsoit would be great if someone could update the summary with Testing instructions for the patch. I’d like to know how to reproduce the content shown on the summary screenshots:- <em>How can be added a highlighted announce?</em> I’d love to check how this is shown without Claro styles.- <em>How can several announcements be added?</em> I’d love to see how it behaves with longer and multilingual text.Re <a href=\\\"#comment-14267057\\\">#56</a> about the icon: I totally agree on a bell as a better representation for notificationsbut the module descriptions says “<em>Notifies site users about latest updates from the Drupal community</em>”. I suggested a speaker because I understood this is not supposed to be a user or site notification featurebut a the community announcements channel.But reading the Release notes snippet from summary the sentence “important information for site owners on older Drupal version” confuses me:> Announcements may include: news about upcoming Drupal featuresimportant information for site owners on older Drupal versionsand information about supporting the Drupal project through Drupal Association programs.If this is supposed to just communicate generic information (not targeted to the current site) I see this type of content different to the site/user communications/notifications. If this is supposed to be integrated at some point as “notifications” (like current site’s updates) maybe it should be something to discuss here. I wouldn't see the Toolbar icon as a blocker at this pointbut I think it'd be good to make clearer what this project isn't supposed to be (a site's notification placeif I'm right).",

    "Comment Body": "I tried to work on the announce module this week but I found it a little hard to make significant progress on this because the high level plans for this project are still a little unclear to me. I've read the ideas queue issue [#2940739] but it didn't answer all of my questions. It explains the high level goals, but doesn't really go into much detail on how we are trying to solve that. I'm wondering if some of the discussion that has happened in person has been documented somewhere outside of the issue?\n\nThere are couple of issues in the announce module issue queue that are asking clarification on some of the key concepts ([#3249644] and [#3249625]). It would be useful to work on those, and document the outcome in the module, as well as potentially adding a summary to this issue. It's important that there's enough understanding on how this new module is intended to work before it is added to core, to make sure that it can be maintained in long term.\n\n<hr>\n\nAre we planning to add this module to standard install profile? Are there plans on enabling this module on existing sites? If we are not adding this module to standard install profile, or enabling it on existing sites, how are we getting users to enable this module on their sites? What's the value the users get out of the module that makes them install it?\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>The style is not consistent between the different theme, on claro and olivero there are difference in spacing, alignement, and even the style of the close button</blockquote>\nIs there already a plan how we can make the design consistent across different themes?",

The communication style of the DA which is very US-like and doesn't work as well in the rest of the world. Are the person/team in charge of approving communications all going to be US-based or will there be a mix of locations?",

But based on <a href=\\\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3206643#comment-14598007\\\">#93</a> a reroll might be required anyway.In regards of the UX review I could put it on the agenda of next weeks meeting? It takes place on the 15th of july Friday at 14:00 UTC (currently 7:00am PT10:00am ET). Today there won't be a regular meeting it looks like and that would also have been on too short notice for someone to join to present and or for answering questions probably. Because it proofed helpful if someone familiar with an issue could find the time to attend the meeting.\"",

There is a link on that issue to a recording of the discussion.</p><p>As I recallthe consensus at that meeting is that it would be better to revive a dashboard: by defaultusers see the dashboard when they log inand that would be a better place to show the announcements. Seeing announcements on login may be just as effective as the link in the toolbarand there would be less clutter in the toolbar.</p><p>We discussed this issue again at [#3315240]. That issue will have a link to a recording. We still think that a dashboard is the better approach. This time aroundthere was more support for the toolbar/settings tray approach as an interim solution. There was still some concern that this approach would make it harder to switch to a dashboard in the long runand that it adds too much clutter to the toolbar.</p><p>The main usability problem we identified is that the red dot is not an effective way to indicate that there are new announcements:</p><ul><li>It is generally bad practice for color to be the <em>only</em> indicator.</li><li>The difference in shape is easy to miss.</li><li>The red dot is easy to miss for users with limited vision.</li></ul><p>We considered a few alternativessuch as the number of new announcements before the word \\\"Announcements\\\". Using the same colors (white text on black) makes it easy to readbut that does not suggest that the number refers to the count of <em>new</em> announcements rather than the total. We think that putting a circle around the numberor using a lightcolored background for the numberwould suggest that.  This is a common pattern in mail apps for mobile devicesfor example.</p><p>One advantage of putting the announcements on a dashboard is that there is more room to convey the information that there are new ones.</p><p>Since we would like to see the announcements added to a dashboard as the long-term solutionthere should be some way to make that happen. I am adding the tag for a follow-up issue: we should have an issue to integrate with Viewsor have some other way to create an Announcements block.</p><p>Another feature request (can be a follow-up issue) is that we provide an individual option to opt out entirelyor to show the link only when there are new announcements.</p><p>We had some other suggestions that are not really related to usability. Some are more the responsibility of the release manager. We were concerned that this module does just one thingand is not easily extensible. Perhaps the architecture could be changed: separate the job of fetching announcements from the job of adding them to the toolbar and the off-canvas dialogue. One or both of those features might be easier to use for other purposes.</p><p>In factthe job of fetching data from an external feed used to be the job of the Aggregator module. Didn’t we just decide to <em>remove</em> that from Drupal core?</p><p>As work continues on this featurekeep in mind extensibility and think about transitioning to a dashboard solution. For examplethere has already been discussion of supporting more than one feed. (Is there a separate issue for that yet?) Perhaps the internal data structure (the variables passed to the Twig templatenot the structure of the feed) should include some identifier for the feed.</p>For the recordthe attendees at today's usability meeting were @AaronMcHale@benjifisher@rkoller@shaal@simohelland @worldlinemine.\"",

    "Comment Body": "i've taken a look at <code>MR2889</code>. One detail i've noticed the color contrast for the label <code>New</code> in red has a too low color contrast. The text has a color of red <code>#ff0000</code>/<code>rgb(255,0,0)</code> and a background color of <code>#464646</code>/<code>rgb(70,70,70)</code> which leads to a color contrast of <code>2,36:1</code> but <code>4,5:1</code> would be required (ref WCAG SC 1.4.3). \n\nin high contrast mode in edge (on macos) the pencil disappears and the closing the sidebar button has also a low color contrast. \n<img src=\\/files/issues/2022-11-17/highcontrast.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"the announcements sidebar in forced high contrast mode in edge\\\" />and i wonder currently the <code>announcements</code> menu item is a link like the other top level ones but it doesnt have the role <code>button</code>. that way it is listed in the rotor under <code>links</code> instead of <code>form controls</code>. the advantage of having a <code>form control</code> like <code>devel</code> (in case installed)<code>shortcuts</code> or <code>manage</code>. the item is announced with for example <code>shortcuts toggle button</code>. and it would also be possible to announce the change of state for the sidebar like <code>devel</code> does with the secondary menu. on key press it announces:tray \\\"developement menu\\\" openedortray \\\"developement menu\\\" closedcurrently when pressing the announcements link the sidebar title immediately gets announced followed by the first content link. having an announcement about the state might be helpful and slow things down? \"",

It would be super cool to release it with D10 launch party :)</blockquote>\n\nI refactored the CSS to use PostCSS and use the new custom properties that are now available in the D10 off-canvas dialog. This also fixes the icon not showing in the toolbar when using forced colors.\n\nI still have a couple questions regarding the CSS and HTML, that I asked within comments within the MR above. \n\nIn addition to this, we need an issue summary update on\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to test out all of the functionality. How do I see featured announcements, or when there's no announcements?</li>\n  <li>What is this supposed to look like? The figma link above just links to one page that says \\Alerts\\\" in the toolbar. I'm guessing this is outdatedbecause the actual module says \\\"Announcements\\\". </li></ul>",

SImilarly, when going from experimental to stable, we'd want to make sure there's fresh/relevant content in the feed too. I don't know what a desirable frequency is, but whatever that is it'll need to be maintained, otherwise it'll look stale/broken.\n\nI haven't actually reviewed the feed parsing (or the code more generally) yet, but I agree with not API-ifying it (or going back to aggregator etc.). If we want to add back an RSS parser to core, we should do that in a separate issue - Zend's parser caused us many, many issues with PHP version support and etc. so I would not want to go back to that.",

    "Comment Body": "<blockquote> Why did we go with a custom format over something like https://www.jsonfeed.org/ ?</blockquote>\n\nThe simple format was made to match the requirements. I was not aware of JSON Feed. It took me a minute to find the spec, here it is: https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/.\n\nWe do have at least one custom element, what version constraint the message applies to. JSON Feed's spec does have an Extensions section, so that would work.\n\nNot much else is really required by the spec, so it would be workable, if we want to go this direction.",

That suggests at least some people are using json_feed with Drupal so given the change would be purely renaming some keys in the custom format to match the spec (hopefully?), that seems like a good change.",

And then part of the process of getting this to stable/adding it to standard/umami would be that those announcements continue to be up-to-date on whatever we think a reasonable schedule is. It's the first time we've added something to core that has an actual content dependency on Drupal.org, except maybe update status in a way, and once it's on sites, unless they uninstall it, core releases can't do anything about the contents of the feed.",

However, reading the JSON Feed extensions spec again I have a couple of comments:\n\n<blockquote>\nFor instance, imagine a podcast directory service — call it Blue Shed Podcasts — that asks a podcaster to specify some additional information about a feed or item. A publisher would do something like this:\n\n<code>\n\\_blue_shed\\\": {\\\"about\\\": \\\"https://blueshed-podcasts.com/json-feed-extension-docs\\\"\\\"explicit\\\": false\\\"copyright\\\": \\\"1948 by George Orwell\\\"\\\"owner\\\": \\\"Big Brother and the Holding Company\\\"\\\"subtitle\\\": \\\"All shoutingall the time. Double. Plus. Good.\\\"}</code>The about string is there for a human looking at the feedso they can understand what goes in the custom extension. It’s optionalbut it should appear at least once in a feed that may contain multiple uses of _blue_shed (preferably in the first usebut that’s not required).Alsoit’s good practice to name an extension with a company or service nameto provide a clue right away as to what it’s for and who made it.</blockquote>Our extension is currently named <code>_extra</code> which isn't very descriptive. I think the extension should be named <code>_drupal</code> or <code>_drupal_org</code> (*not* <code>_drupal.org</code>as that is disallowed) and we should consider an <code>about</code> key that links to a relevant URL - I feel strongly about the former but not so strongly about the latter; we can't easily change the extension key laterbut we could add the <code>about</code> element at any time in the future.",

However, I can start to build more posts into the live feed, even if it isn't really in use yet... speaking of which....\n\nRe: #161 - I think I'll take out the survey concept in the first post entirely, and just put up a post which explains the lay of the land. Then I'll look into trying to get 2 or 3 more posts together, either appropriate reposts about project news from the core news feed, or unique posts.",

I didn't know that.\n\nI see two options: \n1) Remove the absolute positioning of the \\New\\\" word and just place it after the title.2) Assign a fixed width to the title so it never overlaps with the \\\"New\\\" word.For option 2it'd need to be at least a 80%/20% which does not look niceso I'm going to do option 1.Once doneI'll update the snapshot and make a comment here.\"",

That is things I did not work on and were not front endy. I also made \n\nHowever, I think the user will think of this as just 'Announcements' and that 'Feed' is not needed. For example, right now I am looking at the help page which uses 'Announcements Feed' while in the upper right hand corner I see 'Announcements'. Personally, I find that jarring.

A fresh install from this branch works fine.\n\nOnce that was resolved I installed the module and visited the help page to find out what to do next. It suggested that if I had permission I could click the \\Announcements\\\" button in the admin toolbar and otherwise guided me to the online help page. I could not for the life of me fine the Announcements button so I started stepping through with a debugger to see if it was working. Anywaylo and beholdthe Announcements button was there in the top right corner the whole timeI guess I was just focusing on the left hand side.While this seems really obvious nowand I feel silly for taking so long to find itperhaps we could get a screenshot added to the online help page so we know what to expect?\"",

Having said that, I just rebased the MR so thanks for mentioning it.\n\nAfter your comment, I thought about adjusting slightly (<em>\\...situated in the top right...\\\"</em>) the language or adding a screenshotbut the position of the \\\"Announcements\\\" link might change for users with RTLso I left it as it is for nowbut I'm happy to adapt as needed if there are some suggestions that people agree on.\"",

As it stands I don't think that this module offers an API. All classes are final and marked as @internal. Things can be opened up in beta or once this module as stable as necessary.
