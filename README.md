This set of code is used to generate graphs on a webpage. In order to use it, graphing.js must be downloaded. As well, it uses d3v7. See index.html for commented example of how to implement. extras folder contains various files that I am using in development but are completely not necessary for you. json files are data that my page currently uses, but you can specify your own path to the files in your index file. Worth noting however that the read functions are not generalized and as of now work specfically on these files.
