This means that in future if the content size gets bigger both computation and storage gonna be bigger. Proposed resolution Resorting back to the old logic is also not a good idea because of <https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/announce\/issues\/3249661> . But I think drupal updates do re-trigger corn jobs if that so we already have one to deal with it.",

Then the remote loaded ones are version filtered and are validated for <http:\/\/drupal.org|drupal.org> links. I believe Drupal version updates do not necessarily clear the tempstore, so Drupal may show incorrect announcements after a version update. Steps to reproduce Proposed resolution I don't think filtering for versions is expensive, so I think we should always do it. Remaining tasks User interface changes API changes Data model changes",
