There may be more text to review, I only noticed this because I looked at how its enabled and whether it can be disabled.

Accessibility - 
There is not enough color contrast in the content of announcements.

Re. #26: Beware of conflating dialogs and disclosure widgets. These are not the same thing at all. You mention a dialog, but the linked article does not.

Which behaviour is it: a control which invokes a dialog, or a disclosure widget? That's going to make a difference to how the change of content is conveyed.

I share the concerns about the colour contrast. We'll need measurements, but I'm pretty sure these look poor.

Only one of the messages has an associated \"learn more\" link. Why don't the others have this? I'm pretty sure I'd want to learn more about the security releases, say.

<hr>

Some accessibility stuff...

The icons will need to be adaptable to forced-colors modes (previously a.k.a. Windows high-contrast mode). So far, we don't have any multi-colour icons in the toolbar. It's going to need a monochrome representation too.

The screenshots have a lot of dots. What is a dot supposed to signify? It's too vague I think.

The \"learn more\" link looks like a button, but it behaves as a link. It would be better if it looked like a link, namely underlined text rather than a 4-sided border.

The \"learn more\" link has <code>_target=\"blank\"</code> which is a massive pain-in-the-accessible, especially since there is no warning that it will open a new window. It fails WCAG SC 3.2.5 Change On Request (level AAA). We really-really-really need to minimise the use of this attribute.  In this case, let's just remove it.

14219711,"2021-09-15 00:00:00","","One big concern I have here is that this would introduce a whole new pattern in the form of the dialogue/widget/whatever-you-call-it that drops down from the \"Announcements\" toolbar button (I'm going to just call it \"new component\" in this post for simplicity).

This new component introduces a new CSS and some JavaScript, this means additional user interface elements to maintain. Core already provides the off-canvas dialogue, and I think it would be better if that were to just be used here.

The off-canvas dialogue could probably also use some love, but it does not make sense to introduce an entirely new component into Core, with its own separate CSS/JS, when what we already have a suitable component ready to be used.

The existing off-canvas dialogue has already gone through accessibility compliance and is already well integrated with Core and contrib.  The idea that we should then introduce another, very similar component, with its own design, which requires its own separate long-term maintenance, makes me nervous.  We should be aiming for consistency in our Core UI, not divergence.

14220746,"2021-09-16 00:00:00","","I opened an issue in the module queue, otherwise i think it'll be very hard to keep track of all the feedback [#3233439]. In short: JS needs some work, using dialogs API directly, not using jquery when it's not needed, using data attributes instead of classes.

Some feedback not captured in the opened issue: 

<ol>
  <li>I would expect some validation on the link to make sure it's a Drupal/DA controlled domain that it points to. To make sure that if/when the feed itself is compromised we don't send people to a malicious URL.</li>
  <li>The experience is a bit jarring, clicking several times on the announcement link makes the bar \"flash\" because it's making a new request instead of updating what's in there (or not doing anything), probably needs some discussion around what we expect to happen. I would go for several clicks = toggle the sidebar (without refreshing) to keep thing in line with the other buttons of the toolbar</li>
  <li>The icon looks fuzzy to me, it's too small to have shading (or have several version based on display density). Just noticed it's a png, any reason why it's not a svg as well?</li>
  <li>There is a cache by user but if I dismiss a featured announcement it just comes back on the next page reload. I would expect the announcement to not be shown or be shown as a non-featured item. Or maybe it's a feature that it's <em>very</em> visible all the time </li>
  <li>The contrast ratio of the \"normal\" updates probably doesn't pass accessibility guidelines. It's hard to read for me at least</li>
  <li>The style is not consistent between the different theme, on claro and olivero there are difference in spacing, alignement, and even the style of the close button</li>
  <li>For the /announcement page, it should probably be rendered in the admin theme and not the frontend theme no? The announcement toolbar button should probably also be hidden when on that page. There are style missing for the focused close button when viewed as a page</li>
  <li>Thinking about it we should probably remove the close button altogether from the focused announcement, it doesn't do anything, what is needed is a way to downgrade the focused announcement to a \"normal\" one after a while to avoid showing the same thing all the time if there aren't many announcements.</li>
  <li>Focus style are missing for the \"Learn more\" button, can't see anything when it's keyboard focused</li>
</ol>

The contrib module is not in sync with this merge request, I'd advise to keep the two very close as I expect there will be a good number of comments and requests for updates. That's what being done for the CKeditor5 module, see [#3201824] and [#3231364]. The core merge request is generated by a script, i think it'd be  a good idea to follow a similar pattern here. Issues that touch on UX always tend to take a while to get in with many discussions, it's easier to manage and follow when each point has it's own issue. (Like the accessibility feedback could have it's own issue to discuss all accessibility related implications of this new UI, without interferring with folks whose main concern is JS or PHP or CSS :)

But so far it's exciting to see this running on a site!

14221002,"2021-09-16 00:00:00","For those willing to see it","For those willing to see it in action, here's an small gif showing the last code locally:

<img src=\"/files/issues/2021-09-16/projects-message.gif\" alt=\"\" />


On a UX perspective, I'm concerned about how to better communicate visually that those are external links. Specially if it's a forced <code>_target=\"blank\"</code> as @andrewmacpherson mentions. An option would be the <a href=\"https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/107823/is-there-a-common-or-typical-icon-for-an-external-link-to-a-company-web-site\">standard external icon</a>.


On a Design perspective, I think Design should be its own independent point in the remaining tasks list. ;)
1. First, this doesn't follow neither the current <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/OqWgzAluHtsOd5uwm1lubFeH/Drupal-Design-system?node-id=553%3A0\">Design System Claro is implementing</a> nor Seven's. My guess is this implementation is based on Ana Barcelona's work a while ago and the designs have evolved since then. For example, there aren't outlined buttons anymore (like the one on the blue region).
2. Another point is that links should be blue and underlined. Other visual elements should ideally be used to show that that's been \"read\" instead of lowering the color to gray, like block background color, icons, or just use a different elements instead of a basic link.
<img src=\"/files/issues/2021-09-16/links.png\" alt=\"\" />
3. The bell icon, could be simplified to play better with the rest of the icons. On the left, the current icon. On the right, an example of a simpler icon style (no the same color tough).
<img src=\"/files/issues/2021-09-16/icon.png\" alt=\"\" />


On a code perspective:
1. I'd say that we shouldn't be using PNG for icons: it should be SVGs so some accessibility concerns like the ones expressed by Andrew in <a href=\"#comment-14219226\">#27</a> can be addressed.
2. This is also introducing a lot of opinionated CSS (that, as @AaronMcHale mentions, will need to be maintained) that is not following existing guidelines. How will this look like on a site using Seven? I think @lauriii can actually give way better feedback here, but ideally a module should just introduce the minimum styles to make it work and let each of the admin themes add its own visual styles.
3. As you can see on the GIF I've uploaded, there's an overlap between the title and the close button on narrow screens.

That certainly avoids a hard namespace conflict. However I think the soft conflict is still there.

A thesaurus wasn't much help. Broadcast, notice, and update were the best alternatives I could find. Various contrib modules have already used up a lot of possible terms.

Instead of looking for an variation on \"announce\", could we name it after where the messages come from? Recalling the goal, emphasis mine:

</blockquote>

How about \"drupal project announcement\", \"drupal community news\", or something along those lines?

Is there any intention for this UI and/or API to convey messages which <em>don't</em> come from drupal.org as community announcements?

Re. #35:

<blockquote>
On a UX perspective, I'm concerned about how to better communicate visually that those are external links. Specially if it's a forced _target=\"blank\" as @andrewmacpherson mentions. An option would be the standard external icon.</blockquote>

It would be far preferable if the <code>_target=blank</code> wasn't used here, regardless of whether we want to tell people it's an external link.

External-link icons haven't been particularly consistent over the years, and are sometimes confused with share/send actions. I recall the UK government dropped them in favour of visible text to say it was external.

The new bell icon is excellent. I was also going to suggest using a cut-out instead of overlap. It will adapt to forced-colour modes in monochrome; the bell and circle-badge will be the same colour, with a clear separator line. That's a strong affordance that it's an additional badge applied to the bell.

Do the disks on the right hand side signify anything? I was wondering if they mean new or un-visited. I think text would convey this more clearly: \"new\" is what forum module uses.

<h3 id=\"summary-release-notes\">Release notes snippet</h3>

<blockquote>Drupal core now includes an announcements feed of project news from Drupal.org. This feed of announcements is displayed in the Drupal administrative toolbar to site owners/editors, tracking read/unread status with cache tags. Announcements may include: news about upcoming Drupal features, important information for site owners on older Drupal versions, and information about supporting the Drupal project through Drupal Association programs.</blockquote>

<h3 id=\"summary-release-notes\">Governance</h3>

To publish a new piece to this announcements feed should require an extra level of governance and oversight. 

Proposed governance: 
<ul>
  <li>Sign off by a designated Drupal Association staff member</li>
  <li>Sign off by a Drupal Core product manager (per maintainers.txt) </li>
  <li>(When relevant) sign off by another key stakeholder - such as a security working group member for announcements related to security issues, for example.</li>

At first glance this icon looked to me like an axe! I think that's a problem with 2-dimensional silhouette icons. Some of the other megaphone icons on the Noun Project page look clearer:

<ul>
  <li>Some are 3-dimensional. The megaphone's cone shape is apparent.</li>
  <li>Many have some extra lines, the common cartoon way of showing that sound is coming out of it.</li>
  <li>Many have the central part which sticks out from the middle of the megaphone cone.</li>
  <li>A few have a person holding the megaphone. These are verb-focused (talk) rather than noun-focused (megaphone).</li>
</ul>

I don't recall seeing a megaphone icon before. (A very similar-looking icon is a side view of a loudspeaker, which is often used for volume control.)

I don't have hard numbers, but I think the bell icon is a more common icon for \"notify\" or \"message\"?

A speech bubble is another icon which could work for announcement.","andrewmacpherson",265648,"GB","https://www.drupal.org/u/andrewmacpherson",NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,"2023-05-23 00:00:00"
14268347,"2021-10-25 00:00:00","","I think there are a few things that need to be improved before considering a +1. I’m concerned with Claro’s blue and other styles forced into all themes with this CSS.

To give you an idea of what I would expect from this project minimum styles, this is how it would look like reusing the off-canvas already existing styles.

<img src=\"/files/issues/2021-10-25/Captura%20de%20Pantalla%202021-10-25%20a%20les%2012.25.21.png\" alt=\"\" />

I’ve removed locally all the opinionated CSS in <code>announcements_feed.dialog.css</code>, like colors, and left only paddings/margins and hidden undesired visual elements like the default title pencil icon. 
Claro’s visual improvements can be added later as a follow-up, or at least they shouldn't appear when Seven is enabled right now.


Also, it would be great if someone could update the summary with Testing instructions for the patch. I’d like to know how to reproduce the content shown on the summary screenshots:
- <em>How can be added a highlighted announce?</em> I’d love to check how this is shown without Claro styles.
- <em>How can several announcements be added?</em> I’d love to see how it behaves with longer and multilingual text. 

Re <a href=\"#comment-14267057\">#56</a> about the icon: I totally agree on a bell as a better representation for notifications, but the module descriptions says “<em>Notifies site users about latest updates from the Drupal community</em>”. I suggested a speaker because I understood this is not supposed to be a user or site notification feature, but a the community announcements channel. 

But reading the Release notes snippet from summary the sentence “important information for site owners on older Drupal version” confuses me:
> Announcements may include: news about upcoming Drupal features, important information for site owners on older Drupal versions, and information about supporting the Drupal project through Drupal Association programs.

If this is supposed to just communicate generic information (not targeted to the current site) I see this type of content different to the site/user communications/notifications. If this is supposed to be integrated at some point as “notifications” (like current site’s updates) maybe it should be something to discuss here. I wouldn't see the Toolbar icon as a blocker at this point, but I think it'd be good to make clearer what this project isn't supposed to be (a site's notification place, if I'm right).

14296927,"2021-11-19 00:00:00","","I tried to work on the announce module this week but I found it a little hard to make significant progress on this because the high level plans for this project are still a little unclear to me. I've read the ideas queue issue [#2940739] but it didn't answer all of my questions. It explains the high level goals, but doesn't really go into much detail on how we are trying to solve that. I'm wondering if some of the discussion that has happened in person has been documented somewhere outside of the issue?

There are couple of issues in the announce module issue queue that are asking clarification on some of the key concepts ([#3249644] and [#3249625]). It would be useful to work on those, and document the outcome in the module, as well as potentially adding a summary to this issue. It's important that there's enough understanding on how this new module is intended to work before it is added to core, to make sure that it can be maintained in long term.

<hr>

Are we planning to add this module to standard install profile? Are there plans on enabling this module on existing sites? If we are not adding this module to standard install profile, or enabling it on existing sites, how are we getting users to enable this module on their sites? What's the value the users get out of the module that makes them install it?

<p>We discussed this issue at [#3236318], but at that time no one left a comment here. There is a link on that issue to a recording of the discussion.</p>
<p>As I recall, the consensus at that meeting is that it would be better to revive a dashboard: by default, users see the dashboard when they log in, and that would be a better place to show the announcements. Seeing announcements on login may be just as effective as the link in the toolbar, and there would be less clutter in the toolbar.</p>
<p>We discussed this issue again at [#3315240]. That issue will have a link to a recording. We still think that a dashboard is the better approach. This time around, there was more support for the toolbar/settings tray approach as an interim solution. There was still some concern that this approach would make it harder to switch to a dashboard in the long run, and that it adds too much clutter to the toolbar.</p>
<p>The main usability problem we identified is that the red dot is not an effective way to indicate that there are new announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is generally bad practice for color to be the <em>only</em> indicator.</li>
<li>The difference in shape is easy to miss.</li>
<li>The red dot is easy to miss for users with limited vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>We considered a few alternatives, such as the number of new announcements before the word \"Announcements\". Using the same colors (white text on black) makes it easy to read, but that does not suggest that the number refers to the count of <em>new</em> announcements rather than the total. We think that putting a circle around the number, or using a light, colored background for the number, would suggest that.  This is a common pattern in mail apps for mobile devices, for example.</p>
<p>One advantage of putting the announcements on a dashboard is that there is more room to convey the information that there are new ones.</p>
<p>Since we would like to see the announcements added to a dashboard as the long-term solution, there should be some way to make that happen. I am adding the tag for a follow-up issue: we should have an issue to integrate with Views, or have some other way to create an Announcements block.</p>
<p>Another feature request (can be a follow-up issue) is that we provide an individual option to opt out entirely, or to show the link only when there are new announcements.</p>
<p>We had some other suggestions that are not really related to usability. Some are more the responsibility of the release manager. We were concerned that this module does just one thing, and is not easily extensible. Perhaps the architecture could be changed: separate the job of fetching announcements from the job of adding them to the toolbar and the off-canvas dialogue. One or both of those features might be easier to use for other purposes.</p>
<p>In fact, the job of fetching data from an external feed used to be the job of the Aggregator module. Didn’t we just decide to <em>remove</em> that from Drupal core?</p>
<p>As work continues on this feature, keep in mind extensibility and think about transitioning to a dashboard solution. For example, there has already been discussion of supporting more than one feed. (Is there a separate issue for that yet?) Perhaps the internal data structure (the variables passed to the Twig template, not the structure of the feed) should include some identifier for the feed.</p>

14790899,"2022-11-17 00:00:00","","i've taken a look at <code>MR2889</code>. One detail i've noticed the color contrast for the label <code>New</code> in red has a too low color contrast. The text has a color of red <code>#ff0000</code>/<code>rgb(255,0,0)</code> and a background color of <code>#464646</code>/<code>rgb(70,70,70)</code> which leads to a color contrast of <code>2,36:1</code> but <code>4,5:1</code> would be required (ref WCAG SC 1.4.3). 

in high contrast mode in edge (on macos) the pencil disappears and the closing the sidebar button has also a low color contrast. 
<img src=\"/files/issues/2022-11-17/highcontrast.jpg\" alt=\"the announcements sidebar in forced high contrast mode in edge\" />

and i wonder currently the <code>announcements</code> menu item is a link like the other top level ones but it doesnt have the role <code>button</code>. that way it is listed in the rotor under <code>links</code> instead of <code>form controls</code>. the advantage of having a <code>form control</code> like <code>devel</code> (in case installed), <code>shortcuts</code> or <code>manage</code>. the item is announced with for example <code>shortcuts toggle button</code>. and it would also be possible to announce the change of state for the sidebar like <code>devel</code> does with the secondary menu. on key press it announces: 

tray \"developement menu\" opened
or
tray \"developement menu\" closed

currently when pressing the announcements link the sidebar title immediately gets announced followed by the first content link. having an announcement about the state might be helpful and slow things down?

I refactored the CSS to use PostCSS and use the new custom properties that are now available in the D10 off-canvas dialog. This also fixes the icon not showing in the toolbar when using forced colors.

I still have a couple questions regarding the CSS and HTML, that I asked within comments within the MR above. 

In addition to this, we need an issue summary update on

<ul>
  <li>How to test out all of the functionality. How do I see featured announcements, or when there's no announcements?</li>
  <li>What is this supposed to look like? The figma link above just links to one page that says \"Alerts\" in the toolbar. I'm guessing this is outdated, because the actual module says \"Announcements\". </li>

We do have at least one custom element, what version constraint the message applies to. JSON Feed's spec does have an Extensions section, so that would work.

Unless I'm missing something, I don't think #129 is addressed.

I can still only see one post on https://www.drupal.org/announcements.json - it is saying that something is about to be added to core.

If this is merged into core as experimental, then we do not want an announcement that something is going to be added to core, because it'll already be in core, so the information will be at best outdated, at worst confusing/misleading.

The feed should have actual relevant announcements for someone who would test the experimental module, before it's committed, so that they're immediately available once it is. And then part of the process of getting this to stable/adding it to standard/umami would be that those announcements continue to be up-to-date on whatever we think a reasonable schedule is. It's the first time we've added something to core that has an actual content dependency on Drupal.org, except maybe update status in a way, and once it's on sites, unless they uninstall it, core releases can't do anything about the contents of the feed.","catch",35733,"GB","https://www.drupal.org/u/catch","Third and Grove",NULL,0,"Third and Grove",NULL,"2023-05-23 00:00:00"

The changes for this on both sides mostly look good. However, reading the JSON Feed extensions spec again I have a couple of comments:

<blockquote>
For instance, imagine a podcast directory service — call it Blue Shed Podcasts — that asks a podcaster to specify some additional information about a feed or item. A publisher would do something like this:

<code>
\"_blue_shed\": {
    \"about\": \"https://blueshed-podcasts.com/json-feed-extension-docs\",
    \"explicit\": false,
    \"copyright\": \"1948 by George Orwell\",
    \"owner\": \"Big Brother and the Holding Company\",
    \"subtitle\": \"All shouting, all the time. Double. Plus. Good.\"
}
</code>

The about string is there for a human looking at the feed, so they can understand what goes in the custom extension. It’s optional, but it should appear at least once in a feed that may contain multiple uses of _blue_shed (preferably in the first use, but that’s not required).

Also, it’s good practice to name an extension with a company or service name, to provide a clue right away as to what it’s for and who made it.
</blockquote>

Our extension is currently named <code>_extra</code> which isn't very descriptive. I think the extension should be named <code>_drupal</code> or <code>_drupal_org</code> (*not* <code>_drupal.org</code>, as that is disallowed) and we should consider an <code>about</code> key that links to a relevant URL - I feel strongly about the former but not so strongly about the latter; we can't easily change the extension key later, but we could add the <code>about</code> element at any time in the future.

Re: #160 - some specifics: The module has a test fixture which shows what something like 8-10 different types of posts would look like, just so you can see what a more full feed would look like that way. However, I can start to build more posts into the live feed, even if it isn't really in use yet... speaking of which....

Re: #161 - I think I'll take out the survey concept in the first post entirely, and just put up a post which explains the lay of the land.

I agree, pencil is probably not the right icon as it generally implies you can edit something by clicking/tapping it.","AaronMcHale",429621,"GB","https://www.drupal.org/u/aaronmchale",NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,"2023-05-23 00:00:00"

I resolved the few issues I could. That is things I did not work on and were not front endy. I also made 

However, I think the user will think of this as just 'Announcements' and that 'Feed' is not needed. For example, right now I am looking at the help page which uses 'Announcements Feed' while in the upper right hand corner I see 'Announcements'. Personally, I find that jarring. But my personal view aside would it not be better for them to be the same?

@quietone - as long as the machine name remains announcements_feed - I think the display text could be 'Announcements' to address the confusion you are talking about

15014118,"2023-04-17 00:00:00","","As someone who has not followed this at all I thought I'd try this out. First of all the MR needs a rebase. If you install from 10.1 HEAD and switch to this branch you'll get a WSOD. A fresh install from this branch works fine.

Once that was resolved I installed the module and visited the help page to find out what to do next. It suggested that if I had permission I could click the \"Announcements\" button in the admin toolbar and otherwise guided me to the online help page. I could not for the life of me fine the Announcements button so I started stepping through with a debugger to see if it was working. Anyway, lo and behold, the Announcements button was there in the top right corner the whole time, I guess I was just focusing on the left hand side.

While this seems really obvious now, and I feel silly for taking so long to find it, perhaps we could get a screenshot added to the online help page so we know what to expect?","mstrelan",314289,"AU","https://www.drupal.org/u/mstrelan","PreviousNext",NULL,0,"PreviousNext",NULL,"2023-05-23 00:00:00"

After your comment, I thought about adjusting slightly (<em>\"...situated in the top right...\"</em>) the language or adding a screenshot, but the position of the \"Announcements\" link might change for users with RTL, so I left it as it is for now, but I'm happy to adapt as needed if there are some suggestions that people agree on.","fjgarlin",2495842,"ES","https://www.drupal.org/u/fjgarlin","Drupal Association",NULL,1,"Drupal Association",NULL,"2023-05-23 00:00:00"

I'm not sure if this should go in as beta or as alpha. As it stands I don't think that this module offers an API. All classes are final and marked as @internal.
